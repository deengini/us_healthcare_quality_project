# **U.S. Healthcare Quality: Analyzing Mortality and Readmission Rates in Health Facilities Across the United States**

## **Project Description**

This repository hosts a portfolio project by the author based on U.S healthcare. The goal of this project was to measure and analyze the performance of 4413 health faciltiies across 51 U.S states on several key metrics: 

* patient admissions, 

* patient readmissions and 

* patient mortality. 

The performance of health facilities on these metrics where further compared against common health issues in the U.S such as: 

* Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)

* Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)

* Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) 

* Stroke

* Heart Failure 

* Pneumonia

* Issues arising after hospital discharges

* Issues arising after hip/knee replacements

## **Data Source**

The data for this project was found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/us-healthcare-readmissions-and-mortality) on Kaggle

## **Table of Contents**

This repository contains the following: 

* A [Power BI file]() which contains a dashboard of the data. 

* An [image file]() which contains the same dashboard as above but for easier viewing access. 

## **Project Applications**

This project can be applied in various ways in the healthcare industry: 

* It can be used by healthcare administrators to determine what states to allocate more resources 

* It can be used by public administrators to create educational missives or health directives for the general population to develop healthier habits. 

## **Project Limitations**

The major limitation of this project was the fact that about 1/3 of key metric scores for this data were left blank and so only 2/3 was useful.
